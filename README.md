# Efficient data augmentation for multivariate probit models with panel data: An application to general practitioner decision-making about contraceptives
The code here provides a method for sampling the potentially high dimensional correlation matrix in a multivariate probit model for longitudinal data within a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In addition, antithetic sampling is performed to lower the autocorrelation between the iterates of random effects and regression coefficients.

### Getting started
Save all the files in a folder and change MATLAB's current directory to the folder that contains all the saved files.

The main program is `example.m` which loads the simulated data in `simulated_data.mat` and samples all parameters from their posterior distributions.

To run the program, type `example` in the command window and press enter.
