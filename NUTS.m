% function [theta, grad, logp, nfevals, alpha_ave] = NUTS(f, epsilon, ...
% theta0, max_tree_depth, logp0, grad0)
%
% Carries out one iteration of No-U-Turn-Sampler.
%
% Args:
% f - function handle: returns the log probability of the target and 
%     its gradient.
% epsilon - double: step size of leap-frog integrator
% theta0 - column vector: current state of a Markov chain and the
%     initial state for the trajectory of Hamiltonian dynamcis.
%
% Optional args:
% logp0 - double: log probability computed at theta0. See the comment on
%     'grad0' for more info.
% grad0 - column vector: gradient of the log probability computed at 
%     theta0. If both 'grad0' and 'logp0' provided, it will save a bit 
%     (one evaluation of 'f') of computation. The computational gain is
%     rather small when NUTS requires a long trajectory, so this is an
%     optional parameter.
% max_tree_depth - int
%
% Returns:
% theta - next state of the chain
% logp - log probability computed at theta
% alpha_ave - average acceptance probability of the states proposed at the
%     last doubling step of NUTS. It measures of the accuracy of the
%     numerical approximation of Hamiltonian dynamics and is used to find
%     an optimal step size value 'epsilon.'
% nfevals - the number of log likelihood and gradient evaluations one
%     iteration of NUTS required
% grad - gradient computed at theta (to feed into the next iteration of
%     NUTS if desired)
